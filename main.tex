\subsection{Spaces with constant curvature}

Firstly, it considers \( S^2 \), embedded within a 3-dimensional Euclidean space. To do so, it considers its metric \( ds^2 = \delta_{ij} dx^i dx^j \) and the constraint \( x^i x_i = L^2 \), which are satisfied by spherical coordinates with a fixed radius \( R \):

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    x^1 &= L \sin{ \theta } \cos{ \phi }, \\
    x^2 &= L \sin{ \theta } \sin{ \phi }, \\
    x^3 &= L \cos{ \theta },
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

which make our metric become

\begin{equation}
    ds^2 = L^2 \left( d\theta^2 + \sin^2{ \hspace{-2pt}\theta } ~ d\phi^2 \right)
\end{equation}

This sphere is invariant to any \( SO(3) \) transformation because the sphere equation respects euclidean space \( SO(3) \) invariance (we call \(\mathbb{R}^3\) the ambient space of \( S^2 \)). This makes \( S^2 \) homogeneous, that is, any of its points can me mapped to each other by an \( SO(3) \) transformation. This manifold has a constant curvature given by its Ricci scalar \( R = \frac{2}{L^2} \)

\vspace{0.5cm}

We can also consider the hyperbolic space \( H^2 \), of constant negative curvature. However, this manifold cannot be embedded inside the euclidean space which makes it more difficult to imagine. On the contrary, it can be embedded into a 3-dimensional Minkowski space, that is:
\begin{align}
    ds^2 = & - dz^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 \\
    -L^2 = & - z^2 + x^2 + y^2
\end{align}
Similarly to what we considered with \( S^2 \), the hyperbolic space is homogeneous in the sense that it is invariant under \( SO(1,2) \) transformation because of the 'ambient space' it is embedded into. (It is important to note that his space is not a hyperboloid in a three dimensional euclidean space, which would not be homogeneous in the euclidean sense).

\vspace{0.5cm}

Analogously to the sphere case we can define a coordinate system to express this manifold metric:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    x^1 &= L \sinh{ \rho } \cos{ \phi }, \\
    x^2 &= L \sinh{ \rho } \sin{ \phi }, \\
    x^3 &= L \cosh{ \rho },
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

From where we can obtain \( H^2 \) metric
\begin{equation}
    ds^2 = L^2 \left( d\rho^2 + \sinh^2{ \hspace{-2pt}\rho } d\phi^2 \right)
\end{equation}
which show us that this manifold does not have a timelike direction which makes it a space (not a space-time). The Ricci scalar of this space is: \( R = - \frac{2}{L^2} \) \textbf{(An example of an Hyperbolic space is the mass-shell condition in two dimensions)}.

\subsection{Spacetimes with constant curvature spaces}

Everything that has been considered so far were \textit{spaces} with constant curvature, so let's now consider \textit{spacetimes} with constant curvatures. For example the \( AdS_2 \) can be embedded within a spacetime with two timelike directions, \todo{Physical meaning of this spacetime?} with \( ds^2 = -dz^2 - dx^2 + dy^2\). Within this manifold we define the \( AdS^2 \) spacetime as the set of points that fulfil:
\begin{equation}
    -z^2 - x^2 + y^2 = -L^2
\end{equation}

Where we call L the AdS radius. This spacetime respects the SO(2,1) invariance of its ambient space. Again, a set of coordinates can be defined to express this spacetime metric:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    & z = L \cosh{ \rho } \cos{ \tilde{t} } \\
    & x = L \cosh{ \rho } \sin{ \tilde{t} } \\
    & y = L \sinh{ \rho }
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

which makes the \( AdS_2 \) to be of the form
\begin{equation}
    ds^2 = L \left( -\cosh^2{ \hspace{-2pt}\rho } d\tilde{t}^2 + d\rho^2 \right)
\end{equation}

This coordinate system is known as the global coordinates. \textbf{Note that although we embedded AdS in a flat spacetime with two timelike directions, AdS itself has only one timelike direction}

\vspace{0.5cm}

The \( \tilde{t} \), timelike direction, is periodic in \( 2\pi \), which brings up problems with causality. To avoid this problematic, one usually unwraps the timelike direction and considers the covering space of the AdS spacetime, where \( -\infty < \tilde{t} < +\infty \) \todo{I do not really understand this}

\vspace{0.5cm}

The AdS spacetime has a constant negative Ricci tensor \( R = -\frac{2}{L^2} \).

Analogously, we can obtain the de Sitter space time embedded in a Minkowski space with one timelike direction so that:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    ds^2 &= -dz^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 \\
    L^2 &= -z^2 + x^2 + y^2
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The \( dS_2 \) spacetime is homogeneous in the sense that it is invariant under \( SO(1,2) \) transformations. And with the appropriate coordinates:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    & x = L \cosh{ \tilde{t} } \cos{ \theta } \\
    & y = L \cosh{ \tilde{t} } \sin{ \theta } \\
    & z = L \sinh{ \tilde{t} },
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

the metric becomes:

\begin{equation}
    ds^2 = L \left( - d\tilde{t}^2 + \cosh^2{ \hspace{-2pt}\tilde{t} }d\theta^2 \right)
\end{equation}

\textbf{(Note that in this space the timelike direction is not periodic)}.

\vspace{0.5cm}

The \( dS_2 \) has a possitive constant Ricci Tensor \(R = \frac{2}{L^2}\). For applications in AdS/CFT, \( AdS_5 \)\todo{Why five dimensions?} is commonly used and for the dS spacetime, one often considers the \( dS_4 \) for cosmology applications.

\subsection{Various coordiante systems of AdS spacetime}

Until now, we have used the global coordinates to discus AdS spacetime. How ever, through literature we can encounter different coordinate systems:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Static Coordinates} (\( \tilde{t}, \tilde{r} \)): Useful to compare it with AdS Black Holes.

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{r} = \sinh{ \rho }
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{ds^2}{L^2} = -(\tilde{r}^2 + 1)d\tilde{t}^2 + \frac{d\tilde{r}^2}{\tilde{r} + 1}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Conformal coordinates} (\( \tilde{t}, \theta \)):

\begin{equation}
    \tan{ \theta } = \sinh{ \rho }
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{ds^2}{L^2} = \frac{ 1 }{ \cos^2{ \hspace{-2pt}\theta } }\left(-d\tilde{t}^2+d\theta^2\right)
\end{equation}

In this coordinate system, we encounter an spatial "boundary" at \( \theta \rightarrow \pm \pi/2 \), known as the AdS boundary which is located at \( \tilde{ r } \rightarrow +\infty \) in static coordinates and at \( r \rightarrow +\infty \) in the Poincaré coordiantes that I will define afterwards. The existence of this boundary means that one should specify the boundary condition on the AdS boundary in order to solve initial-value problemes. \todo{I do not understand why this is not trivial, as we already had to consider conditions at the infinity} "This boundary condition corresponds to specifying external sources one adds in the gauge theory side"\todo{Do not fully understand this}.

\vspace{.5cm}

\textbf{Poincare Coordinates} (\( t,r \)):

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        z &= \frac{Lr}{2}\left(-t^2 + \frac{1}{r^2} + 1 \right), \\
        x &= Lrt, \\
        y &= \frac{Lr}{2}\left(-t^2 + \frac{1}{r^2} - 1 \right):
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\[ r > 0 ~~~ ; ~~~ -\infty < t < +\infty \]

\begin{equation}
    \frac{ds^2}{L^2} = -r^2 dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{r^2}
\end{equation}

This is the coordinate system most used in AdS/CFT, and also useful to compare with the AdS black hole.

\newpage

\subsection{Higher Dimensions}

This space and spacetime we have discussed so far can be easily generalized to the higher dimensional case.

\vspace{.5cm}

\textbf{The sphere} \( S^{p+2} \). The p+2-sphere has the SO(p+3) invariance (homogeneous with respect to \( \mathbb{R}^{p+3} \)). Additionally it is SO(p+2) invariant (SO(p+2) is a subgroup os SO(p+3)), which allow us to write the metric:
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = d\omega_1^2 + ... + d\omega_{p+3}^2 ~~~:~~~ \omega_1^2 + ... + \omega_{p+3} = L^2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        ds^2 = L^2d\Omega_n^2 ~~~:~~~ d\Omega_n^2 &= d\theta_1^2 + \sin^2{ \hspace{-2pt} \theta_1} d\Omega_{n-1}^2 \\
                                                &= d\theta_1^2 + \sin^2{ \hspace{-2pt} \theta_1} d\theta_2^2 + ... + \sin^2{ \hspace{-2pt}\theta_1 }\sin^2{ \hspace{-2pt}\theta_{n-1} } d\theta_n^2  
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
    : 0 \leq \theta_i < \pi (1 \leq i \leq n-1) ~~~\&~~~ 0 \leq \theta_n < 2\pi
\end{equation*}

\textbf{The hyperbolic space} \( H^{p+2} \). The p+2-hyperboloid has the SO(1,p+2). Additionally it is SO(p+2) invariant (SO(p+2) is a subgroup os SO(1,p+2)), which allow us to write the metric, which allow us to define the metric as:
\begin{equation}
    ds^2 = - dx_0^2 + ... + dx_{p+2}^2 ~~~:~~~ -x_0^2 + ... + x_{p+2} = -L^2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{ds^2}{L^2} = d\rho^2 + \sinh^2{ \hspace{-2pt} \rho } d\Omega_{p+1}^2 : x_0 = L\cosh{ \rho } ~~~;~~~ x_i = L\sinh{ \rho } \omega_i
\end{equation}
\textbf{The \( AdS_{p+2} \) spacetime}. The \( AdS_{p+2} \) spacetime has the SO(2, p+1) invariance, so:
\begin{equation}
    ds^2 = - dx_0^2 - dx_{p+2}^2 + ... + dx_{p+1}^2 ~~~:~~~ - x_0^2 - x_{p+1}^2 + ... + x_{p+2} = -L^2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    ~~:~~ x_0 = L\cosh{ \rho }\cos{ \tilde{t} } ~~~;~~~ x_{p+2} = L\cosh{ \rho }\sin{ \tilde{t} } ~~~;~~~ x_i = L\sinh{ \rho } \omega_i
\end{equation}
which, define the global coordinates for \( AdS_{p+2} \):
\begin{equation}
    \frac{ds^2}{L^2} = -\cosh^2{ \hspace{-2pt}\rho} d\tilde{t}^2 + d\rho^2 + \sinh^2{ \hspace{-2pt} \rho } d\Omega_{p}^2
\end{equation}
Also, in static coordinates the metric takes the form:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{ds^2}{L^2} = -(\tilde{r}^2 + 1) d\tilde{t}^2 + \frac{d\tilde{r}^2}{\tilde{r}^2+1} + \tilde{r}^2 d\Omega_{p}^2
\end{equation}
And, in conformal coordinates where \( \tan\theta := \sinh\rho \)
\begin{equation}
    \frac{ds^2}{L^2} = \frac{1}{\cos^2{ \theta }}\left( -d\tilde{t}^2 + d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\Omega_p^2 \right)
\end{equation}

And in the Poincaré coordinates,
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        x_0 &= \frac{Lr}{2}\left( y_i^2 - t^2 + \frac{1}{r^2} + 1 \right), \\
        x_{p+2} &= Lrt, \\
        x_i &= Lry_i ~~~ (i = 1,...,p), \\
        x_{p+1} &= \frac{Lr}{2}\left( y_i^2 - t^2 + \frac{1}{r^2} - 1 \right),
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
the metric becomes
\begin{equation}
    \frac{ds^2}{L^2} = r^2\left( -dt^2 + d\mathbf{y}_p^2 \right) + \frac{dr^2}{r^2}
\end{equation}
\textbf{When p=3, the metric coincides with the near-horizon limit of D3-brane}\todo{I guess I am not supposed to understand this}.

\newpage

\textbf{The \(dS_{p+2}\) spacetime}. The \(dS_{p+2}\) spacetime has the SO(1, p+2) invariance so:
\begin{equation}
    ds^2 = - dx_0^2 + ... + dx_{p+1}^2 ~~~:~~~ - x_0^2 + ... + x_{p+1} = L^2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    ~~:~~ x_0 = L\sinh{ \tilde{t} } ~~~;~~~ x_i = L\cosh{ \tilde{t} } \omega_i
\end{equation}
Then, the metric becomes
\begin{equation}
    \frac{ds^2}{L^2} = -d\tilde{t}^2 + \cosh^2{ \hspace{-2pt}\rho }d\Omega_p^2
\end{equation}

\textbf{Notes: The maximally symmetric spacetimes: I do not understand the groups that defines these spacetimes.}

The maximally symmetric spacetime has a cosmological constant:
\[
    \Lambda = \pm\frac{p(p+1)}{2L^2}
\]

\section{Particle motion in AdS spacetime}

\textbf{Gravitational Redshift.} A photon emmited from the origin in static coordinates and received at \(\tilde{r} = \tilde{r}_B \ll 1\) and the photon suffers a redshift:
\begin{equation}
    E_B \simeq \left(\frac{1}{\tilde{r}_B}\right)E_A \Longrightarrow E_B \ll E_A
\end{equation}

Then, if \( \tilde{r}_B \rightarrow \infty, E_B \rightarrow 0 \), which means that the photon gets an infinite redshift, similarly to a black hole, even though this space is not a black hole. (\( \tilde{t} = 0\) is the bottom of the gravitational well)

\textbf{Photon Motion.} If we consider a photon traveling from the origin to the infinity in static coordinates we obtain that the timelike coordinate it takes him is finite, while its affine parameter is infinite.

\textbf{Particle Motion.} If we consider a massive particle, we find that it cannot reach the boundary of AdS (because of the potential well) and that it takes a finite proper time to comeback to the origin. It also takes finite timelike coordinate to comeback to the origin and they are indeed, identical. 

\textbf{Poincaré Coordinates and Poincaré patch}: A photon take infinite timelike coordinate in the poincare coordinate, to go from a distance \( r=R \) to \( r=0 \), but finite proper time. \textbf{This is similar to scharwarchild coordinates.}.

As the photon reaches r=0 in a finite affine parameter, the Poincaré coordinates must only cover part of the full AdS called the Poincaré Patch. (If not this spacetime would be geodesically incomplete)\todo{Do not really understand this concept. And also, what should I think about this region?}

\vspace{.5cm}

\textbf{I do not really understand this last part of the Section in the book. I have some notes on the article of things I still have to figure out}

\section{AdS/CFT interpretations}

\textbf{The symmetries of the AdS spacetime} The metric of \( AdS_5 \) in Poincare coordinates:

\begin{equation}
    ds_5^2 = \left(\frac{r}{L}\right)^2(-dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2) + L^2\frac{dr^2}{r^2}
\end{equation}\todo{L on the denominator?}

This spacetime is SO(2,4) invariant. This metric is invariante under the isometry group ISO(1,3) on \(x^\mu \), which corresponds to "the Poincare invariance of the dual gauge theory in four-dimensional spacetime", so \( x^\mu \) is interpreted as the coordinates of this gauge theory.

\vspace{.5cm}

This metric is also invariante under
\begin{equation}
    x^\mu \longrightarrow ax^\mu ~~~~,~~~~ r \longrightarrow \frac{1}{a}r
\end{equation}

Under \textbf{scaling}\todo{What does scaling really mean?} transforms as energy, which is conjugate to t "\textbf{This is the reason the gauge theory is four-dimensional whereas the gravitational theory is five-dimensional}". This is, the r coordinate is interpreted as the energy scale of the gauge theory.

\vspace{.5cm}

"\textbf{N = 4 SYM has the scale invariance, while the invariance in the dual gravitational theory is realized geometrically}"

\vspace{.5cm}

If we examine the duality further, the time coordinate in the gauge theory is t not the proper time \( \tau \) (Which are related by \(d\tau_r^2 = |g_{00}(r)|dt^2\) for the proper time of a \textbf{static observer})

Additionally, propper energy for the observer at r, is related to the gauge theory energy, \(E_t\) by UV/IR relation:
\begin{equation}
    E_t=\sqrt{|g_{00}|}E(r)\simeq\left(\frac{r}{L}\right)E(r)
\end{equation}
The gauge theory energy will be larger if it is located nearer to the AdS boundary.

\vspace{.5cm}

\textbf{I do not really understand the Hawking temperature and proper temperature part}
